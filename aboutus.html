            Starting from nothing, players drop into the Hollow Lands to loot, increase in power, and defeat enemy players in order to become the ultimate battlemage. Run, jump, levitate, dash, fly and teleport around your opponents in order to decimate them with
            powerful Spells & Sorceries obtained from Gauntlets. Increase your stats and acquire new abilities as you pick up equipment found in Chests throughout the Hollow Lands. As you traverse the land a trail will be left behind
            you when levitating, allowing other players to more easily spot your position. You will also find giant rifts in the ground caused by The Fracture, that will immediately exile any player unfortunate enough to fall in. Ending the match for
            them. Your goal will be to escape from the Spellstorm and either outlasting or exiling your opponents through combat until you're the last one standing.</p>

        <p class="tiga">
            Spellbreak currently has 2 different Game Modes. All of them take place on the Hollow Lands map, but with variations on the gameplay experience.</p>
    
        <h1 style="color:beige;font-size:44px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;padding-top: 40px;">Classic - Battle Royal</h1>
    
        <img class="mode1" src="Assets/spellbreak-impressions-6.png" alt="none" height="500px
        " width="800px">
        <p class="empat">
            In this game mode, the player can queue as either solo, duo or squad (three players). If you queue as duo or squad, you also have a "fill" option, which allows others entering the lobby to fill up empty slots in your party. In solo queue, the player will
            immediately be exiled upon death, ending the match and dropping all their items and equipment in the process. In duo & squad queues, the player disrupts into a wisp upon death and starts fading away over 90 seconds. This allows them to be
            Resurrect Icon.png revived by a teammate after a 5 second channel, recovering 40 health. Should they fail to be revived in time, or if their remainding squad is disrupted as well, they will be exiled. They can also be exiled
            prematurely by an opponent following a 5 second channel. The channel will be interrupted upon any damage taken if the player is exiling, but not if reviving. Each game lobby can house a maximum of 42 players..</p>
    
    
        <h1 style="color:beige;font-size:44px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;padding-top: 40px;">Clash - Team Death Match</h1>
    
        <img class="mode1" src="Assets/clashmode.jpg" alt="none" height="500px
        " width="800px">
        <p class="empat">
            In Clash two teams of up to 9 players are pitted against each other, in a race to be the first to reach the required score and win the game. This required score is equal to 3 times the total player count at match start. So for a full lobby of 18 players,
            the required score will be 54. Each exile will add one point to the total score of the opposing team. Upon being exiled, the player will drop all their equipment as usual, but the match will not end for them. Instead, after 8 seconds they
            will respawn and drop from a random portal within the current safe zone. They will spawn with full health and armor, duplicate equipment and 2 Small Armor Shard.png small armor shards in their inventory. However, one should expect to be exiled
            often as there is no LargeHP Consumable.png consumbles to be found anywhere on the map. In addition, equipment of Common rarity is removed from the loot tables of Chests. Finally, the starting safe zone is much smaller in
            Clash as opposed to Classic, and the Spellstorm closes in faster.</p>
